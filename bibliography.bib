	abstract = {We are building Coral, a peer-to-peer content distribution system. Coral creates self-organizing clusters of nodes that fetch information from each other to avoid communicating with more distant or heavily-loaded servers. Coral indexes data, but does not store it. The actual content resides where it is used, such as in nodes’ local web caches. Thus, replication happens exactly in proportion to demand. We present two novel mechanisms that let Coral achieve scalability and high performance. First, a new abstraction called a distributed sloppy hash table ({DSHT}) lets nodes locate nearby copies of a file, regardless of its popularity, without causing hot spots in the indexing infrastructure. Second, based on the {DSHT} interface, we introduce a decentralized clustering algorithm by which nodes can find each other and form clusters of varying network diameters.},

The {URI} syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid {URIs}, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a {URI} reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This specification does not define a generative grammar for {URIs}; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each {URI} scheme. [{STANDARDS}-{TRACK}]},
