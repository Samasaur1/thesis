Thank you to Erica, my thesis advisor, for guiding me through this entire process. Hopefully I didn't stress you out too much.

Thank you to Greg, Zajj, and Mary, my orals board, for your insightful questions and comments. I hope you had as much fun talking about my thesis as I did.

Thank you to everyone I worked with at CUS, for helping make it the best job I have ever had. Thank you especially to Ben and Taylor for the interesting challenges I got to solve and the trust to solve them.

Thank you to all the CS professors I have had, for making sure I didn't regret my choice of major.

Thank you to all the non-CS professors I have had, especially Ellen, for proving every day the value of a liberal arts education.

Thank you to all the friends I have made here at Reed, for keeping me going throughout these four years.
Thank you especially to Catherine, who has kept me sane the whole time.
Thank you to Beth, Daniel, and Eliana, who have stuck by me since the start.
Thank you to Aziz, Max, Vaughn, and too many more of you to name individually.
Thank you to everyone in rc&f, who made fun of me a perfectly reasonable amount but were supportive and excited about the things I accomplished nonetheless.

And thank you to my family, who got me here, and always wanted to hear about what I was doing, even when they didn't understand a word.

You all mean more to me than I can say.
