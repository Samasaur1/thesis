Thank you to Erica, my thesis advisor, for guiding me through this entire process.

Thank you to everyone I worked with at CUS, for helping make it the best job I have ever had. Thank you especially to Ben and Taylor for the interesting challenges I got to solve and the trust to solve them.

Thank you to all the CS professors I have had, for making sure I didn't regret my choice of major.

Thank you to all the non-CS professors I have had, especially Ellen, for proving every day the value of a liberal arts college. I have not regretted the choice.

Thank you to all the friends I have made here at Reed, for keeping me going throughout these four years. Thank you especially to Catherine, Beth, Eliana, and Daniel, who have stuck by me since the start.

And thank you to my family, who got me here, and always wanted to hear about what I was doing, even when they didn't understand a word.

You all mean more to me than I can say.
