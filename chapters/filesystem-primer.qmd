# File system Primer {#sec-filesystem-primer}

The filesystem is a very complex beast, but we can mostly ignore these complexities.

File paths are made up of a series of *path components* --- think folder names. To build a complete path, we join path components with a *path separator*. On most operating systems, the path separator is `/`, while on Windows it is `\`.

Like concurrency, we run into issues when trying to write to a file twice at the same time. This may or may not be caught by the operating system, so we must be careful to avoid this situation.

We can also jump around within a file, so we do not need to save files to disk linearly from start to finish.
