# Example images

![alt text](../images/wizard.png){#fig:wizard}

And let's reference that image. Which image? \ref{fig:wizard} or \autoref{fig:wizard}.

Try Pandoc/Quarto references? @fig:wizard

Let's try this again with the Quarto-recommended prefix:

![alt text](../images/wizard.png){#fig-wizard}

And let's reference that image. Which image? \ref{fig-wizard} or \autoref{fig-wizard}.

Try Pandoc/Quarto references? @fig-wizard aka [Image @fig-wizard] which is number [-@fig-wizard]
